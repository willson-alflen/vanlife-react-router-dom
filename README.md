## Project Overview
This project is a web-based application designed for renting vans. Users have the ability to create an account, rent or list their own vans, and provide ratings and reviews for vans. Initially developed during the Frontend Career Path course on Scrimba, additional features were added independently to further enhance skills.


### Course Accomplishments
During the course, the following tasks were completed:

1) Creation of the project and establishment of the base layout.
2) Implementation of React Router for navigation.
3) Development of most pages, excluding the Add Van page.
4) Utilization of Mirage JS for simulating API calls.
5) Exploration of various concepts including routes, links, outlet context, search parameters, accessibility, protected routes, and authentication.

### Additional Stretch Goals
In addition to the course content, the following enhancements were made:

1) Reconstruction of the app using Vite + React.
2) Integration of styled-components for styling.
3) Integration of Firebase for data storage related to vans, users, and rentals.
4) Adaptation of API function calls to utilize Firebase.
5) Implementation of Firebase authentication using email and password.
6) Utilization of the Context API for managing user data.
7) Addition of a page allowing users to list their own vans.
8) Creation of a page simulating a real transaction for renting vans.
9) Implementation of a mock payment process using Stripe JS.
10) Development of responsiveness for various screen sizes.

### Future Goals
1) Implementation of unit and/or end-to-end app tests.
2) Integration of user authentication using Google.
3) Enhancement of the user account page to allow users to add/edit additional personal/account information.
4) Addition of a blog and subscription page to expand functionality.
